# Controls when the workflow will run

  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the master branch
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/master' # we tell Github to only execute this step if we're on our master branch (so we don't put unfinished branches in production)
